                    <br><strong>About Me</strong><br> name is Ellis Simmons. Im 15, almost 16. I play the trupet and I go to school at pittsburgh CAPA.
                    Some of my hobbies include gaming, playing the trumpet, coding, and solving rubiks cubes.
                    I've been solving Rubiks cubes for about 2 years, and i can solve them in about 30 seconds.
                    I go to pittsburgh CAPA and I am a rising Junior. I enjoy science, and english(most of the time)
                    and I <u>love</u> gym. At school I major in trumpet (which means I have to play it for 3 hours a day)
                    and it's ok. <br><br><br><strong>Trumpet</strong><br> I have been playing the trumpet for about 6 years. I take private lessons and lessons at school,
                    which means that I have to practice it every day. I just went to another trumpet teacher
                    becuase my last one retired becuase of COVID-19.
