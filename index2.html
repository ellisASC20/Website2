            My first time coding was in 7th grade, when we took a class on Processing 3. It was really fun and
            I thought it would be a good thing to continue, so i kept coding. The next year we could take a class
            on processing again, so I decided to take it. In 10th grade, I took a camp on Javascript and Python, and over
            the summer, learned HTML and CSS by myself. I also kept coding in Proessing over this time. Here are 3 of my favorite
            projects that I've done. Although picture 2 is not animated i promise the ball is bouncing.
